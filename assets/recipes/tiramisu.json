Whisk together the egg yolks and 3/4 cup of the sugar in the bowl. Continue whisking until the sugar has dissolved, the mixture has increased slightly in volume, and it looks light yellow color. Not sure? Rub a little of the mixture between two fingers (it will be warm, but not too hot to touch) – it should feel smooth and silky; if you feel any sugar granules, keep whisking."

,"text": "Whip the mascarpone and cream: You can use either a hand mixer or a stand mixer with a whisk attachment for this step. If using a stand mixer, be very attentive and do not walk away while the mascarpone is whipping. Stand mixers are so powerful, that it&#39;s easy to overwhip, which causes the mascarpone to separate. You have a little more wiggle room with a hand mixer. With a hand mixer or in the bowl of a stand mixer with a whisk attachment, beat the mascarpone on medium speed for 15 to 30 seconds, until it smooths out and softens. Be careful not to over-beat or else the mascarpone will separate and become grainy. With the mixer still on medium speed, gradually add the cream in a thin, slow stream until it&#39;s all incorporated. This should take 1 to 2 minutes. Stop the mixer and scrape down the bowl. Continue beating with the mixer on medium-high speed for another 30 to 60 seconds, until the mixture holds firm, not-quite-stiff peaks."

Read in the comment to soak the ladyfingers longer in the coffee, if you're using Forno Bonomi Savoiardi Ladyfingers, please don't soak it too long. It absorbs liquid real fast. I was so afraid of overbeating the cream and mascarpone, turned out it took me longer that 30-60 seconds to get the peak. The whole portion is quite big for my baking dish."
